[keepachangelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
[semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

## [2.0.2] - 2024-09-09

### Fixed

- Handling last position in `PositionProvider`.

### Removed

- Browser-specific builds. If you need to use AGTree in browser environment, you can use jsDelivr's automatic builds
  or bundlers like Webpack / Rollup / ESBuild without any issues, AGTree does not have any non-browser-compatible code.

[2.0.2]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/agtree-v2.0.2

## [2.0.1] - 2024-09-06

### Added

- Support for uBO's legacy `script:inject` mask.
- Support for uBO's redirect priority in the compatibility table name normalization.
- `resource_types` field to the redirects compatibility table.
- Support for converting network rules to uBO syntax.

### Fixed

- Conversion for uBO's `rc` and `ra` scriptlets.
- Converter now unescape scriptlet separators from the previous rule, if needed (e.g. it unescape commas when converting
  from uBO to AG syntax).

[2.0.1]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/agtree-v2.0.1

## [2.0.0] - 2024-08-15

### Added

- Integrated `@adguard/css-tokenizer` package.
- Adjustable syntax parsing. This makes possible to disable parsing of uBO and ABP syntaxes, which can be useful when
  parsing known-syntax filters.
- `PositionProvider` to convert offsets to line/column pairs.
- `OutputByteBuffer` and `InputByteBuffer` utility classes.
- Binary serialization / deserialization for AST nodes. Practically, this means adding `serialize` and `deserialize`
  methods to AGTree classes.
- `decodeTextPolyfill` and `encodeIntoPolyfill` utility functions.
- `includeRaws` parser option.
- `HostRuleParser` parser class to make it possible to parse host-like rules to `HostRule` node.
- Compatibility table API.
- Compatibility table wiki, which is generated via the compatibility table API.
- Protected Audience API directives to `$permissions` modifier validator.
- Possibility to convert scriptlet rules to uBO syntax.
- Performance benchmarking.

### Changed

- Reworked CSS parsing. Now it is based on `@adguard/css-tokenizer` package, and only necessary parts of CSS are parsed.
- Consistent signature for all parser classes: `ParserClass.parse(source, options)`.
- Location parsing now optional. It can be disabled by passing `isLocIncluded: false` option to the parsers. This
  reduces memory consumption and improves performance if location is not needed.
- Modifier node's `modifier` property renamed to `name`.
- `ScriptletInjectionBodyParser` divided into `AdgScriptletInjectionBodyParser`, `UboScriptletInjectionBodyParser`
  and `AbpSnippetInjectionBodyParser`.
- Locations (`offset`, `line`, `column`) are changed to only one `offset` value. If you need to get line/column, you
  should use `PositionProvider` class.
- Parser functions signature to `parse(source, options, baseOffset, ...additionalArgs)`.
- Removed `Parameter` node from the AST and replaced it with `Value` node.
- If a parameter is empty, it parsed as `null` instead of empty string.
- `SimpleCommentParser` now has a separate class.
- Logical operator types are now consistent, we only use the `OperatorValue` enum.
- Reworked the compatibility table structure.
- Library now use CJS.
- `version` export renamed to `AGTREE_VERSION`.

### Fixed

- HTML rule converter now correctly handles the new `:contains()` syntax.
- Location handling for `FilterListParser`.
- Performance issues.

### Removed

- `@adguard/scriptlets` library. It is not needed anymore, because AGTree now has its own compatibility tables.
- `css-tree` library. It is not needed anymore, because AGTree now uses `@adguard/css-tokenizer` package.
- `##^`/`#@#^` and `##+`/`#@#+` from the cosmetic rule separator finder. Instead, `##`/`#@#` is used, and the `^`/`+` is
  checked in the body parser.

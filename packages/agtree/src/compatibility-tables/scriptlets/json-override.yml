    - name: rawNeedlePaths
      required: false
      description: A list of space-separated properties which must be all present for the pruning to occur. It also accepts property chains.

      required: false
      description: |-
        A string to look for in the raw string, before it's passed to JSON.parse.
        If no match is found no further search is done on the resulting object.
        If the string begins and ends with a slash (/), the text in between is treated as a regular expression.

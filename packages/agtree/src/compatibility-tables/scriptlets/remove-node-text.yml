  parameters:
    - name: nodeName
      required: true
      description: The name of the node for which the text content must be removed.
    - name: includes
      required: true
      description: A string or regex to find in the text content of the node as the target of removing.
    - name: tokens
      required: false
      description: |-
       Available tokens:
         `includes, pattern`: A string or regex which must be found in the text content of the node in order for the removing to occur
         `excludes, pattern`: A string or regex which must not be found in the text content of the node in order for the removing to occur
         `sedCount, n`: This will cause the scriptlet to stop after `n` instances of removing. Since a mutation observer is used by the scriptlet, it's advised to stop it whenever it becomes pointless. Default to zero, which means the scriptlet never stops
         `stay, 1`: Force the scriptlet to stay at work forever
         `quitAfter, ms`: This tells the scriptlet to quit `ms` milliseconds after the page has been loaded, i.e. after the `DOMContentLoaded` event has been fired

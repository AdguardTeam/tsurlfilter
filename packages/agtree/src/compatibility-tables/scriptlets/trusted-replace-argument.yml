  parameters:
    - name: methodPath
      required: true
      description: String path to a native method (joined with `.` if needed). The property must be attached to `window`.
    - name: argumentIndex
      required: true
      description: String index of the argument to replace (0-based).
    - name: argumentValue
      required: true
      description: |-
        String value to set for the argument. If it starts with `replace:`, it is treated as a replacement pattern in the format `replace:/regex/replacement/`. To replace all occurrences of a pattern, the replacement string must include the global flag `g`, otherwise only the first occurrence will be replaced. If it starts with `json:`, it is treated as a JSON string to parse and set for the argument.
        If it does not start with `replace:` or `json:`, it is treated as a constant value to set for the argument, or as one of the predefined constants.
    - name: pattern
      required: false
      description: String or regular expression pattern to match the argument against. If provided, the argument will only be replaced if it matches this pattern.
    - name: stack
      required: false
      description: String or regular expression that must match the current function call stack trace.
    - name: verbose
      required: false
      description: String, if set to `true`, logs the method arguments. Defaults to `false`. It may be useful for debugging but it is not allowed for prod versions of filter lists.

  parameters:
    - name: propChain
      required: true
      description: The property chain to the function which argument must be replaced when called.
    - name: argposRaw
      required: true
      description: The zero-based position of the argument in the argument list. Use a negative number for a position relative to the last argument. Use literal `this` to replace the value used in `prototype`-based methods.

      required: true
      description: |-
        The replacement value, validated using the same heuristic as with the set-constant.js scriptlet.
        If the replacement value matches `json:...`, the value will be the json-parsed string after `json:`.
        If the replacement value matches `repl:/.../.../`, the target argument will be replaced according the regex-replacement directive following `repl:`.
    - name: tokens
      required: false
      description: |-
        Available token:
          `condition, pattern`: The replacement will occur only when pattern matches the target argument.

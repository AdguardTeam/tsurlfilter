    - name: selectors
      required: true
      description: |-
        The CSS/Xpath selector that an HTML element must match for the event to be triggered. Maximum 7 selectors are supported.
        Take a look at the optional parameters and the examples below for the explanation of how they should be written.
    - name: $trigger
      required: false
      description: |-
        If this flag is not set, only the chosen event for the last selector will be triggered.
        $trigger flag can be used for the other selectors to make sure the event is triggered for them as well.
        $trigger is always true for the last selector so can be omitted for it.
    - name: $delay
      required: false
      description: Determines how much time the snippet should wait before simulating the even. Note that the default is 500 ms. If you don't want to have a delay, you should explicitly state $delay=0.
    - name: $continue
      required: false
      description: |-
        If set, the event will be triggered after each delay period ends. For example, if the selected event is click and the delay is 500 ms. The click event will be triggered every 500 ms instead of just once.

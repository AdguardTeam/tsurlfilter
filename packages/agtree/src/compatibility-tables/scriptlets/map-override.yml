      description: "The Map function to override. Possible values to override the property with: `set`, `get`, `has`"
    - name: needle
      required: true
      description: |-
        The string or regex used to determine which function calls to trap.
        If the needle matches the parameter to the function call, the snippet will work, else the function will behave as normal.
        If the string begins and ends with a slash (/), the text in between is treated as a regular expression.
        For 'set' this matches the value. For 'get' and 'has' this matches the key.
    - name: returnValue
      required: false
      description: The return value for the matched function calls. For 'set' ignored. For 'get' the value to return. For 'has', true or false.
      default: "''"
    - name: path
      required: false
      description: Path to look for the needle. Only relevant for 'set' method when checking for object values.
      default: "''"
    - name: stack
      required: false
      description: |-
        Comma separated list of strings to check in the stack trace.

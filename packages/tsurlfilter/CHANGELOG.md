## [2.2.14] - 2024-02-13

  It provides the same performance, but at the same time uses less memory

  In addition to that, it solves the problem of leaking links to the original leaking strings
  that in turn was leading to higher memory usage.

[2.1.4]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.1.4

## [2.1.3] - 2023-06-26

- New `$to` modifier to match requests by target domains and subdomains.
- In the MV3 declarative converter, the obsolete `$mp4` and `$empty` are now
  converted by replacing them with `$redirect` rules.
- Support for $removeheader modifier in the MV3 converter.

### Fixed

- Rule converter incorrectly converting network rules with regexp.

[2.1.3]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.1.3

## [2.1.2] - 2023-06-19

### Changed

- The algorithm of priority calculation: adding more accurate calculation
  of weights for each rule type - more details in [KnowledgeBase#196].
- `$all` modifier is one NetworkRule rule with all included options.
- Removed `$csp` modifier from `$all` (`$inline-font` and `$inline-script`).
- `$document` in blocking rule now just puts content-type: document (main_frame).
- Exception with `$document` modifier, for example in rule
  `@@||example.com^$document` is an alias for
  `$content,jsinject,elemhide,urlblock`.
  In all other cases, `$document` is treated as a regular content-type modifier.
- Exceptions with `$urlblock` disables `$cookie` rules.
- `$redirect` rules are higher in priority than blocking rules.
- Exceptions are higher in priority than `$redirect` and blocking rules.
- `$important` is higher than all others.

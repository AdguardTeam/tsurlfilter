## Unreleased

### Added

[#377]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Scriptlets/issues/377

## [2.2.19] - 2024-04-03

### Added

- Simple support of `$header` modifier â€” just for compiler validation.

[2.2.19]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.2.19

## [2.2.18] - 2024-03-29

### Fixed

- Do not block "Should collapse" mechanism with `$popup` rules.

[2.2.18]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.2.18


## [2.2.17] - 2024-03-28

### Changed

- Updated `@adguard/scriptlets` to `v1.10.25`.

[2.2.17]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.2.17


## [2.2.16] - 2024-03-28

### Fixed

- Correct work `$all` and `$popup` when they both selected for request [#2620], [#2728].

[2.2.16]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.2.16
[#2620]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2620
[#2728]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2728


## [2.2.15] - 2024-03-01

### Changed

- `$popup` should not disable simple blocking rule [#2728].

[2.2.15]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/tsurlfilter/releases/tag/tsurlfilter-v2.2.15
[#2728]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/issues/2728


## [2.2.14] - 2024-02-13

### Added

- New `BufferRuleList` class that is supposed to replace `StringRuleList`.
  It provides the same performance, but at the same time uses less memory
  as the original filter list is stored as a UTF-8 encoded byte array.
  In addition to that, it solves the problem of leaking links to the original leaking strings
  that in turn was leading to higher memory usage.

- `$document` in blocking rule now just puts content-type: document (main_frame).
- Exception with `$document` modifier, for example in rule
  `@@||example.com^$document` is an alias for
  `$content,jsinject,elemhide,urlblock`.
  In all other cases, `$document` is treated as a regular content-type modifier.
- Exceptions with `$urlblock` disables `$cookie` rules.
- `$redirect` rules are higher in priority than blocking rules.
- Exceptions are higher in priority than `$redirect` and blocking rules.
- `$important` is higher than all others.

# DNR Converter Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

- `RegularRuleConverter` now uses a template method (`groupConverted()`) instead
  of having each subclass duplicate `convert()`. `CspConverter` and
  `RemoveHeaderConverter` override `groupConverted()` instead.
- Renamed `DEFAULT_DEST_RULE_SETS_DIR` to `DEFAULT_DEST_RULESETS_DIR` in the CLI.
- Updated `.eslintrc.cjs` to align with other packages: separated
  `builtin`/`external` import groups, added `@adguard/**` pathGroups,
  added `curly` rule.
- Renamed `test/src/rulesets/` to `test/src/ruleset/` to match source directory
  naming.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale `@typedef` import paths in `TooManyError` subclasses (pointed to
  non-existent `../../source-map` instead of `../../ruleset/source-map`).
- Fixed README: repo URL, added `$urltransform` and `$cookie` to supported
  modifiers, corrected `NetworkRule[]` → `Rule[]` in ConverterOptions docs.
- Removed redundant `FilterConverterOptions` duplicate export.

### Removed

- Deleted dead `bamboo-specs/scripts/dnr-converter-tests.sh` (never referenced
  by CI).

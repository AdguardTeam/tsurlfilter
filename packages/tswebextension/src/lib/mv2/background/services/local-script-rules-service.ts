 * By the rules of AMO we cannot use remote scripts (and our JS rules can be counted as such).
 * Because of that we use the following approach (that was accepted by AMO reviewers):
 *
 * 1. We pre-build JS rules from AdGuard filters into the JSON file.
 * 2. At runtime we check every JS rule if it's included into JSON.
 *    If it is included, we allow this rule to work since it's pre-built. Other rules are discarded.
 * 3. We also allow "User rules" to work since those rules are added manually by the user.
 *    This way filters maintainers can test new rules before including them in the filters.

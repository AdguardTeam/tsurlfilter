         * This is STEP 4.2: Apply Scriptlet functions from pre-built filters — via chrome.scripting API.

         *
         * To fully comply with Chrome Web Store policies regarding remote code execution,
         * we implement a strict security-focused approach for Scriptlet and JavaScript rules execution.
         *
         * 1. Default - regular users that did not grant User scripts API permission explicitly:
         *    - We collect and pre-build script rules from the filters and statically bundle
         *      them into the extension - STEP 1. See 'updateLocalResourcesForChromiumMv3' in our build tools.
         *      IMPORTANT: all scripts and their arguments are local and bundled within the extension.
         *    - These pre-verified local scripts are passed to the engine - STEP 2.
         *    - At runtime before the execution, we check if each script rule is included
         *      in our local scripts list (STEP 3).
         *    - Only pre-verified local scripts are executed via chrome.scripting API (STEP 4.1 and 4.2).
         *      All other scripts are discarded.
         *    - Custom filters are NOT allowed for regular users to prevent any possibility
         *      of remote code execution, regardless of rule interpretation.
         *
         * 2. For advanced users that explicitly granted User scripts API permission -
         *    via enabling the Developer mode or Allow user scripts in the extension details:
         *    - Custom filters are allowed and may contain Scriptlet and JS rules
         *      that can be executed using the browser's built-in userScripts API (STEP 4.3),
         *      which provides a secure sandbox.
         *    - This execution bypasses the local script verification process but remains
         *      isolated and secure through Chrome's native sandboxing.
         *    - This mode requires explicit user activation and is intended for advanced users only.
         *
         * IMPORTANT:
         * Custom filters are ONLY supported when User scripts API permission is explicitly enabled.
         * This strict policy prevents Chrome Web Store rejection due to potential remote script execution.
         * When custom filters are allowed, they may contain:
         * 1. Network rules – converted to DNR rules and applied via dynamic rules.
         * 2. Cosmetic rules – interpreted directly in the extension code.
         * 3. Scriptlet and JS rules – executed via the browser's userScripts API (userScripts.execute)
         *    with Chrome's native sandboxing providing security isolation.
         *
         * For regular users without User scripts API permission (default case):
         * - Only pre-bundled filters with statically verified scripts are supported.
         * - Downloading custom filters or any rules from remote sources is blocked entirely
         *   to ensure compliance with the store policies.
         *
         * This implementation ensures perfect compliance with Chrome Web Store policies
         * by preventing any possibility of remote code execution for regular users.

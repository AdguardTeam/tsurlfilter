## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-01

### Added

- New `TsWebExtension.initStorage` method to initialize persistent values for
  the background script.
- New `createTsWebExtension` function to create `TsWebExtension` instance.

### Changed

- [BREAKING CHANGE] In preparation for using event-driven background scripts,
  we started using a session store to persist application context on restart.
  Since the extension session store CRUD operations are asynchronous, we added
  protection against reading the context before initialization to avoid
  unexpected behavior. Some code that depends on this restored data may be
  called before the `start` method to prepare the `configuration`, so we split
  the initialization process into two parts: the new `initStorage` method, which
  is called as soon as possible and allows access to the actual context before
  directly starting the filtering, and the `start` method, which initializes
  the filtering process.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] `TsWebExtension` constructor now accepts submodules as
  arguments. To get the `TsWebExtension` instance with `webAccessibleResources`
  param, use the new `createTsWebExtension` method.
